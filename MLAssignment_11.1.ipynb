Boosting refers to a family of algorithms that are able to convert weak learners to strong learners. The main principle of boosting is to fit a sequence of weak learners− models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees− to weighted versions of the data. The predictions are then combined through a weighted majority vote (classification) or a weighted sum (regression) to produce the final prediction.\n"
